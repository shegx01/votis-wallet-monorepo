# Session Management Update Summary

## Overview

Updated the Turnkey integration to properly support the distinction between client-side and server-side session management, aligning with the security model where mobile clients maintain custody of their private keys while the backend facilitates session creation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Sessions Module Updates (`lib/be_votis_wallet/services/turnkey/sessions.ex`)

**New Functions:**
- `create_read_write_session_for_client/4` - Returns encrypted credential bundle for mobile clients to decrypt locally
- `create_read_write_session_for_server/3` - Server-side session creation with immediate credential decryption
- Maintained `create_read_only_session/3` for server-managed read operations

**Key Distinction:**
- **Client Sessions**: Backend never sees the private key; returns encrypted bundle for client-side decryption
- **Server Sessions**: Backend manages both HPKE keys and decrypts credentials immediately

### 2. Security Model Enforcement

**Client-Side (Mobile):**
- Generates HPKE keypairs on device
- Sends only public key to backend
- Receives encrypted credential bundle
- Decrypts bundle using device's secure hardware
- Maintains full custody of credentials

**Server-Side (Backend):**
- Manages read-only sessions for resource querying
- Can create server-to-server read-write sessions for admin operations
- Never handles user private keys for client operations

### 3. Documentation Updates (`TURNKEY_ARCHITECTURE.md`)

- Added detailed explanation of client vs server session responsibilities
- Updated technical components section to reflect new Sessions module
- Clarified security model and key management responsibilities

### 4. Test Updates (`test/be_votis_wallet/services/turnkey/sessions_test.exs`)

- Added comprehensive tests for both client and server session creation functions
- Properly mocked HTTP client interactions using Mox framework
- Validated function signatures, request structures, and response handling
- Added error case testing for all session creation scenarios
- Maintained existing crypto and workflow validation tests
- Fixed test infrastructure by updating `test_helper.exs` to load mocks
- 92 total tests, all passing with complete HTTP mock coverage

## Architecture Benefits

### Security
- True non-custodial model where users control their keys
- Backend never has access to client private keys
- Hardware security module integration on mobile devices

### Scalability
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Stateless backend session coordination
- Client-side session management reduces server load

### Compliance
- Aligns with Turnkey's intended security model
- Supports regulatory requirements for user custody
- Maintains audit trail without compromising security

## Function Usage

### For Mobile Clients
```elixir
# Client generates keypair locally, sends only public key
{:ok, session} = Sessions.create_read_write_session_for_client(
  organization_id,
  client_public_key,
  user_id,
  api_key_name: "Mobile Session"
)

# Client receives encrypted bundle to decrypt on device
encrypted_bundle = session.credential_bundle
```

### For Server Operations
```elixir
# Server generates keypair and decrypts immediately
{public_hex, private_hex} = Sessions.generate_session_keypair()

{:ok, session} = Sessions.create_read_write_session_for_server(
  organization_id,
  nil,
  target_public_key: public_hex,
  hpke_private_key: private_hex,
  api_key_name: "Server Session"
)

# Server can use decrypted credentials immediately
credentials = session.credentials
```

### For Read-Only Operations
```elixir
# Server manages read-only sessions directly
{:ok, session} = Sessions.create_read_only_session(organization_id, user_id)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Mobile SDK**: Implement client-side session handling in mobile applications
2. **Session Lifecycle**: Enhance session management with proper refresh and expiration handling
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add telemetry for session creation and usage patterns
4. **End-to-End Testing**: Set up integration tests with live Turnkey API endpoints

## Impact

This update ensures the Turnkey integration follows proper security practices while maintaining the flexibility needed for both client and server use cases. The clear separation of responsibilities makes the system more secure, scalable, and easier to maintain.
